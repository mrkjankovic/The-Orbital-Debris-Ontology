#The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)
The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO) is an ontology representing debris objects in orbit about Earth, i.e., orbital debris objects. It represents these orbital object and the relationships between them and the Earth (or any planetary reference frame). It involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in space. The central focus is awareness of the orbital space environment to ensure safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.) 

###NOTE###
As such, it is part of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) or Space Domain Awareness (SDA). ODO classes may be part of a broader Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO), a Space Domain Awareness Ontology, or Space Domain Ontology (SDO), Space Object Ontology (SOO), or an Orbital Object Ontology (OOO)--see my other repositories.

##Status##
Seeking opportunities to sustainably develop this long-standing project. For example, seeking...
* researcher position, or
* PhD or MS fellowship, or 
* partners/colleagues/co-workers/collaborators

...to realize the concept

##Historical Context##
This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (Documentation, including references, verifying this five-year ideation is available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD post, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this with others. I have developed a number of papers on this to make it a Phd project. Interested potential co-authors are welcome to contact me.
