  "body": "### Ontology Description\r\nODO is an ontology of the orbital debris or space debris domain. It contains classes of the types of orbital debris as well as classes and relations of relevant and related orbital entities. The purpose and goals of ODO (and related ontologies by the author) are (i) to offer formal models of the domain, (ii) generic terminilogies and taxonomies, (iii) foster data-sharing and fusion among space debris and space object catalogues, and (iv) help ameliorate the orbital debris problem.\r\nReference: \"An Ontological Architecture of Orbital Debris Data\"(Rovetto, 2015) DOI: 10.1007/s12145-015-0233-3\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nUnder development as circumstances permit. The ontology creator seeks an funded opportunity to sustainable develop ODO, as well as collaborators/partners. \r\n\r\n### Author/Creator\r\nRobert J.
