  "body": "### Ontology Description\r\nODO is an ontology of the orbital debris or space debris domain. It contains classes of the types of orbital debris as well as classes and relations of relevant and related orbital entities. \r\nReference: \"An Ontological Architecture of Orbital Debris Data\"(Rovetto, 2015) DOI: 10.1007/s12145-015-0233-3\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nUnder development as circumstances permit. The ontology creator seeks an funded opportunity to sustainable develop ODO, as well as collaborators/partners. \r\n\r\n### Creator\r\nRobert J. Rovetto\r\nORCID: 0000-0003-3835-7817\r\nhttp://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Rovetto:Robert_J=\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Rovetto\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
